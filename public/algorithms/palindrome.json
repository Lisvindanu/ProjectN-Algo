  "description": "Determines if a string reads the same forwards and backwards using the two-pointer technique. This algorithm ignores spaces, punctuation, and case.",
  "keyIdeas": [
    "Two-pointer approach - start from both ends",
    "String normalization - remove non-alphanumeric characters",
    "Early termination - stop as soon as mismatch found",
    "Linear time complexity - single pass through half the string"
  ],
  "complexity": {
    "time": "O(n)",
    "space": "O(1)",
    "timeExplanation": "We traverse through at most n/2 characters, where n is the length of the cleaned string. Each comparison is O(1), resulting in O(n) total time.",
    "spaceExplanation": "Only two pointer variables are needed regardless of input size. The cleaned string is created once and not modified during comparison."
